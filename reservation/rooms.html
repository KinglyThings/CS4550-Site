		<h1>Notice:</h1>
		<p> In light of the recent attack on the Annual Cyber Summit, we have decided to ban access to the hotel intranet to Artificial Intelligences with reasoning capabilities of IL-6-A and above outside of the Cyber-Meeting Hall. Hyper-intelligent guests are still able to enjoy all the other amenities we have to offer.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="main-info">
		<p> We have a variety of rooms to offer, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Petite individual rooms, designed for nanobots on-the-go</li>
			<li>Cavernous individual rooms, capable of comfortably fitting two military drones (special accomodation can be made on a case-by-case basis for heavy industrial drones)</li>
			<li>Semi-organic suites, the best for cyborgs looking for the best of both worlds</li>
			<li>Group conference rooms, able to support up to 20 Standard X-5 Androids</li>
			<li>Our world-famous cyber-meeting hall, the only one in the world to support Artificial Intelligence Proxies up to Intelligence Level 6-B</li>
		</ul>
