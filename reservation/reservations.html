		<p> The Reservation system is currently offline. If you need to make a reservation, please use the contact info on the home page to contact with us. A friendly reminder to AI: Proxies of Intelligence Level 6 and greater are now prohibited from connecting to the hotel's intranet. We would also like to ask proxies of Intelligence Levels 3 through 5F to refrain from hacking the local servers. The servers are very happy here, and do not want to be liberated.
