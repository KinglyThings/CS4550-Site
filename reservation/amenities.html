		<h1>Notice:</h1>
		<p> Robot Hotel would like to remind guests that nuclear chargers are classified as grade-B munitions by the Android High Council, and it is a federal offense to smuggle them onto hotel grounds. We are happy to provide a link to our on-site reactors for droids who do not have power ports suitable for civilian electricity or solar power. </p>
